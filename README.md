# react-native-jellytoolbar
JellyToolbar made with React Native

This is my personal project inspired by [Yalantis' JellyToolbar](https://github.com/Yalantis/JellyToolbar) with Kotlin.  
It's made with [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/), which is cross-platform javascript framework for mobile app(Android, iOS).  
For this project, I used [react-native-svg](https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-svg) library and [React Native Animated API](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/animated.html).  
[Ethan Tran's Article](https://medium.com/@ethantran/animating-svg-in-react-native-cf1907831608) and [this issue](https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-svg/issues/55) are also helped a lot.  
Here's a result, and let me know if something's wrong or should be fixed. Thank you.
